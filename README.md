To install dependencies and start the project : 

cd chess-backend 
npm install

cd ..
cd chess-ui 
npm install 

Then, open these 2 folders in two terminals and run npm start for both. 
For now, frontend is served on localhost 3000 and express is listeing to port 4000




To be able to play 

Open 2 localhost:3000 in your browser. Do the same process on each screen : create a user, wait a bit to see the active chat Rooms, enter a chat room. 
Once you've done this with 2 users, you will be able to challenge the other user that you've created. Then you see the chess game engine and play your game vs yourself !
